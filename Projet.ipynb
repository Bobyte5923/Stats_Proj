    "Using the dataset 'Popular Video Games' from Matheus Fonseca Chaves posted on kaggle.com ([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matheusfonsecachaves/popular-video-games/data?select=backloggd_games.csv)), we tried to show interesting facts about video games genres released from 1952 to 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the analysis, we cleaned the data from unwanted columns and converted some values to make them usable for analysis :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conversion of the 'Number of plays' : Expressed with thousand and million suffixes (e.g. 24K), we converted it to numbers so the values can be user for calculation and chart representation.\n",
    "- Conversion of 'Release date' : Expressed in a string of type \"Feb 25, 2022\", we converted it to numpy dates so they can be used to calculate and plot values based on date.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then analysed and plot data in 3 ways :\n",
    "- Number of games per genre\n",
    "- Most played games\n",
    "- Success per genre over the years\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"number of games per genre\" analysis shows which genres have the most released number of games. The results show that Adventure games and Indie games are the most released genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"most played games\" analysis sorts the games by 'number of plays'. It shows that Minecraft and The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild are the most played games of all time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"success per genre over the years\" analysis calculates a \"success score\" for each game based on rating and number of plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis allows the user to show the evolution of a genres success over time and to compare between 2 genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last analysis shows that the \"success\" globally drops after 2017. We have 2 hypothesis to explain this drop :\n",
    "1. Recent games have less \"plays\" than long established games\n",
    "2. Most recent released games may have incomplete data\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there seems to be some \"strange\" data in the dataset. For example, a game released in 2029 is present (the title pun is based on that entry). Some very old games are also present in the data but some years are empty. We know that the video game industry has really grown after the 80's but if a game released in 1952 is mentioned, we may think that some games from 1952 to 1980 may not be included in the dataset.\n",
